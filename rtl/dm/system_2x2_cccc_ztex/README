Testbench for the system_2x2_cccc_ztex
======================================

This is a sample system with 4 compute tiles, a mesh network and debug support,
for simulation with ModelSim. The "host PC" connection is done through the GLIP
TCP support instead of USB, other than that this design is identical to the 
system_2x2_cccc_dm_ztex design.


GLIP Sources
------------
This design contains the GLIP communication interface. To update to a newer
version, copy

GLIP_SRC/src/backend_tcp/logic/systemc/glip_tcp_toplevel.cpp

into this directory.
