# Distributed Memory Systems

The following distributed memory systems are available:

 * `compute_tile`: A single compute tile without NoC

 * `compute_tile-dual`: A compute tile with two cores

 * `compute_tile-quad`: A compute tile with four cores

 * `compute_tile-octa`: A compute tile with eight cores

 * `system_2x2_cccc`: A 2x2 mesh NoC with four compute tiles

 * `system_2x2_cccc_dual`: The same system with two cores per tile

 * `system_2x2_cccc_quad`: The same system with four cores per tile
